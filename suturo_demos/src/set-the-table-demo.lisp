;; If called with mode "nav" it will only test the navigation part of the demo
;; If called with mode "perc" it will only test the first perception part of the demo
;; If called with mode "mani" it will only test the first manipulation part of the demo, using fake perception poses
;; If called with mode "perc2" it will only test the second perception part of the demo
;; If called with mode "mani2" it will only test the second manipulation part of the demo, using fake perception poses
;; If called with mode "all" it will test the whole demo
;;
;; IMPORTANT:
;; This parameterization is working, but its WIP. Thinking of writing a macro for it or using another alternative
;; So far it worked in speeding up our testing, since we dont constantly have to add and remove stuff from the
;; code to test specific parts, although this also has its limits, for example we currently cant test perception
;; and manipulation with just one call, without using 'all', which obviously also triggers navigation
